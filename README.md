# Student-Information-Form
This project is a web-based Student Registration Form , that allows users to input and manage student information for educational purposes. The form consists of two main sections: Personal Information and Academic Information.

Additionally, the form provides a "SUBMIT" button to save the entered data and a "RETRIEVE" button to fetch and update existing student records using their unique student ID.

The project aims to simplify the process of registering and managing student information, making it convenient for educational institutions to gather and maintain accurate records for each student. The form utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and interactions, while PHP is used to handle data processing and interaction with a MySQL database.
